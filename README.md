# Kissland
The Kubernetes manifest for my personal cluster, called Kissland.

This node is running the excellent [`k3s`](https://k3s.io/) distribution. It hosts the following services:
- PostgreSQL database: more of an utility service, this is the database powering most other services.
- [Gurkbot](https://github.com/gurkult/gurkbot/): The open source Discord bot of the [Gurkult](https://gurkult.com) community
